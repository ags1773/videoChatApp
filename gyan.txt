Signaling:
- WebRTC can't create P2P connections without a some sort of a server in the middle
- This is called signal channel or signaling service
- This is any sort of communication channel to exchange info to set up connection
- Info to exchange is the Offer and the Answer which contains SDP (Session Description Protocol)
- Offer contains caller's proposed configuration for the call (codec, source address, and timing information of audio and video)
- Answer contains the callee's description of his end 
- This way, both exchange the information needed in order to exchange media data
- This exchange is handled using ICE (Interactive Connectivity Estabilishment)
- ICE is a protocol which lets devices use an intermediary to exchange offer/answer even if they're
  separated by NAT

- Each peer now keeps two descriptions in hand:
  local description: describing itself
  remote description: describing other person
- this process is performed initially when the call is estabilished, and also when the calls config 
  needs to change
