WebRTC provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs

WebRTC enables peer-to-peer (direct from one user to another, without a server) data sharing

APIs for WebRTC:
1) getUserMedia : take input from user (Mic/screen/webcam)
2) Peer Connection : 
        - encode/decode media
        - send it over network
        - take care of NAT transversal
        - other stuff
3) Data channel - browser to browser communication


1) getUserMedia:
- HTML5 made it possible to access the device hardware by exposing high level Javascript APIs
    examples: - Geolocation (GPS)
              - WebGL (GPU)
              - Web audio API

- navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() allows web apps to use the device's webcam and microphone
- video.srcObject = stream : Instead of feeding a URL of a media file, we give the <video> a MediaStream
- also <video autoplay> 'autoplay' is enabled, so <video> won't freeze after 1st frame
