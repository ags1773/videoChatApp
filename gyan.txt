Signalling Server:
2) On connection from peer A, make an entry into 'sockets' object with socket.id as key
4) on getting 'join' request from peer A, as there is no one else connected, do nothing
6) On connection from peer B, make an entry into 'sockets' object with socket.id as key
8) on getting 'join' request from peer B, 
  - broadcast an 'addPeer' event containing PeerB's socket id. This will be recieved by PeerA
  - emit an 'addPeer' event containing PeerA's socket Id. This will be caught by PeerB
  - so now, PeerA has gotten an 'addPeer' with PeerB's socket ID, and vice versa

PeerA (initiator):
1) initiate socket connection with signalling server
3) emit 'join' event 

PeerB (callee):
5) initiate socket connection with signalling server
7) emit 'join' event
